# Placeholder

This directory will contain the `libdart.so` binary for arm64-v8a architecture.

To add the Dart binary:

```bash
cp /path/to/compiled/dart-sdk/bin/dart libdart.so
```

The binary must be:
- Compiled for Android ARM64 (aarch64)
- Renamed to `libdart.so`
- Placed in this directory before building the APK

Example path from the Dart SDK build:
```
/home/ns/Documents/ws/dart-sdk/sdk/out/ReleaseAndroidARM64/dart-sdk/bin/dart
```

Once added, the app will automatically detect and use it instead of extracting the Dart binary from assets.
